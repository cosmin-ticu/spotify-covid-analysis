This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cosmin-ticu/spotify-covid-analysis) contains all the codes, data files and outputs used in analytics questions for the Spotify music trends throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, as part of the term assignment of the Coding 3 Python course. It is advised to download this entire repository as a ZIP or to clone it onto your local machine and set up its root folder in Jupyter Notebook. This will allow you to run the codes and functions seamlessly.

Special credits go to:
* Eszter Somos - provided skeleton of the codes, functions and guidance to conduct the data analysis during her course
